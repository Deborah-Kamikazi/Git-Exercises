    <p>You can reapply stashed changes with the commands git stash apply and git stash pop.
         Both commands reapply the changes stashed in the latest stash (that is, stash@{0}). 
         A stash reapplies the changes while pop removes the changes from the stash and reapplies 
         them to the working copy. Popping is preferred if you don't need the stashed changes to
          be reapplied more than once.

        You can choose which stash you want to pop or apply by passing the identifier as the last argument</p>
